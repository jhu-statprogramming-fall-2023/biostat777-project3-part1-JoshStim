Package Author and Maintainer: Thomas Lumley <t.lumley@auckland.ac.nz>
Project Author: Josh Stim <jstim1@jh.edu>

URL to the original Leaps GitHub repository: https://github.com/cran/leaps
URL to deployed pkgdown website: https://jhu-statprogramming-fall-2023.github.io/biostat777-project3-pkgdown-JoshStim

Five Website Customizations:
1. Applied minty theme by modifying template section in _pkgdown.yml
2. Added a "Browse Source Code" link on the home side bar. This brings the user to the Leaps GitHub Repository
3. Created an index.md file to be used for populating the home page of the website
4. Added "External Demos" tab in the navigation bar. Includes links to other articles that demonstrate the leaps package.
5. Included an "R Documentation" link to the home side bar. This brings the user to the Leaps RDocumentation page

Description:
"This package performs an exhaustive search for the best subsets of a given
set of potential regressors, using a branch-and-bound algorithm, and also 
performs searches using a number of less time-consuming techniques. It is
designed to replace the "leaps()" command in S.  It is based on FORTRAN77
code by Alan Miller of CSIRO Division of Mathematics & Statistics, which is
described in more detail in his book "Subset Selection in Regression". 
Parts of the code have been published in the Applied Statistics algorithms series. 

There are several minor but useful improvements over the S implementation.
Firstly, there is no hard-coded limit to the number of variables.
Secondly, it is possible to restrict the search to subsets of at most
a specified size, potentially giving a large saving in time. Thirdly,
it is not necessary that the matrix of possible predictors be of full
rank. This is particularly useful when there are more predictors than
cases and the best "small" model is wanted. Fourthly, when there are
many more cases than predictors, the search can be run on the output
of biglm() and the time and memory use are then independent of the
number of observations."

Exported Classes and Functions:
leaps	 Subset selection by `leaps and bounds' compatible with S. 

  - "...performs an exhaustive search for the best subsets of the variables in x for predicting y in linear regression, using an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm. It is a compatibility wrapper for regsubsets does the same thing better." - From R Documentation

regsubsets	More sophisticated function, including formula method

  - "Model selection by exhaustive search, forward or backward stepwise, or sequential replacement." - From R Documentation

How to Install:
```{r}
install.packages("leaps")
library(leaps)
```

Example (`leaps`):
```{r}
x<-matrix(rnorm(100),ncol=4)
y<-rnorm(25)
leaps(x,y)
```

Example (`regsubsets`):
```{r}
data(swiss)
a<-regsubsets(as.matrix(swiss[,-1]),swiss[,1])
summary(a)
b<-regsubsets(Fertility~.,data=swiss,nbest=2)
summary(b)

coef(a, 1:3)
vcov(a, 3)
```
